# What is this?

- It's just a slide deck of ideas.
- Prototype report - i.e. unpolished, probably out of order and using a combination of real and fabricated data. Its a intellectual construction zone *so watch your step.*
- I've been experimenting with various methods and metrics CSI could use to report on it's activities to stakeholders, methods of identifying needs and documenting success.
- Goals:
  - Give CSI as much *useful* information as possible for planning and troubleshooting purposes.
  - Automate as much as possible so using it for RCC Metrics and the like is less time consuming.
  - Automate as much as possible so referring to it often is actually possible.
  - Make it something we could host in a dashboard for regular viewing.
  


## Outline

- **CSI Overview** - Description of CSI's resources.
- **Investigational Pipeline** - Methods of looking at our efficiency.
- **Dissemination** - Measures of publication success.
- **Highlights** - Manually assembled slides, basically just a placeholder for the big successes we want to see individually.
- **Key Performance indicators** - Metrics for describing our success and efficiency.
- **Financial** 
  - How have we used our money?
  - What are we seeking? What do we need?
  - Are we competitive relative to the "guns for hire?"
- **Personnel Load** - Ways at describing workload balance across individuals.
- **Ideas for marketing** - self explanatory.

# Key Performance Indicators

These are all potential methods I came up with to measure the performance of CSI in terms of productivity and efficiency in producing research and supporting organizational priorities.

## Primary

- Total Publications for `r REP_YEAR`: `r nrow(df_manuscripts[df_manuscripts$Year == REP_YEAR,])`
  - Journal Publications: `r nrow(df_manuscripts[df_manuscripts$Year == REP_YEAR & df_manuscripts$type == "Journal",])`
  - Trauma: 10
  - MAGNATE: 10
  - Grant 1: 10
- Department Impact factor: $Citations\ of\ year/publications_{year-1} + publications_{year-2}$

## Efficiency Indicators

We'll have to build some tables and databases to support these:

- Time in Backlog
- Ratio of study Active/Inactive time
- Publications/proposal - need to table linking pubs to proposals
- Publications/submission - need table linking submissions to pubs
- Manuscripts/dataset - need table linking manuscripts to datasets
- Manuscripts/proposal - need table linking manuscripts to proposal
- Manuscripts/dataset - need table linking dataset to manuscripts
- Work hours/proposal - need employee timetracking sheets
- Work hours/dataset - need employee timetracking sheets
- Work hours/analysis - need employee timetracking sheets
- Work hours/manuscript - need employee timetracking sheets

## Financial Indicators

- Cost/publication - need expense data
- Publications/Dollar spent
- Cost/Trauma publication
- FTE by role per publication/production stage

# Financial 
## Expenses

```{r}

data.frame(cost = c(50000,
                    25000,
                    30000),
           program = c("Trauma", 
                       "Magnate", 
                       "Miscellaneous")) %>% 
  ggplot(
    aes(
      x = "",
      y = cost,
      fill = program
    )
  ) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_polar(theta = "y") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    x = "",
    y = "",
    fill = "Program"
  )

```


## Grants/Revenue

### Maintained
- MOONSHOT - $500,000

### Pending
- HRSA - $350,000

### Total Revenue for 2021
 - $111,111,111

## Savings to Organization

The existence of "guns for hire" for getting ACS Level 1 certification means we have external competition. The best protection against this is a demonstration of our market value (everything we've demonstrated so far) plus a show of how much money we save the organization relative to that competition. This builds the case for our mainanence and expansion.

This would be displayed basically as Our Costs - Competition Costs = Net Savings

# Personnel Load

## Purpose

This section discusses things that can be used to assess the workload across the organization, who has capacity for extra projects, and who could use a break.

## CSI Personnel Load

```{r}
df_si_key %>% 
  left_join(
    df_investigators,
    by = "investigator_id"
  ) %>%
  left_join(
    df_studies,
    by = "study_id"
  ) %>% 
  filter(
    organization == "Billings Clinic",
    department == "CSI"
  ) %>% 
  group_by(
    name,
    Program
  ) %>% 
  summarise(
    count = n()
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(
    aes(x = reorder(name,count),
        y = count,
        fill = Program)
  ) +
  geom_bar(stat='identity') +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_classic() +
  labs(
    title = "Studies supported by personnel",
    x = "Name",
    y = "Count"
  )
```

## Scientist Load

```{r}
df_si_key %>% 
  left_join(
    df_investigators,
    by = "investigator_id"
  ) %>%
  left_join(
    df_studies,
    by = "study_id"
  ) %>% 
  filter(
    organization == "Billings Clinic",
    department == "CSI",
    role == "Scientist"
  ) %>% 
  group_by(
    name,
    Program
  ) %>% 
  summarise(
    count = n()
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(
    aes(x = reorder(name,count),
        y = count,
        fill = Program)
  ) +
  geom_bar(stat='identity') +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_classic() +
  labs(
    title = "Studies supported by personnel",
    x = "Name",
    y = "Count"
  )
```

## Work Hours Use

- How are work hours used by role on each program? Each stage of the scientific process? By role?
- Could show by as proportion of FTE, total hours, etc.

```{r}
df_ts %>% 
  group_by(
    id_type
  ) %>% 
  summarise(
    time = sum(time, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(
    aes(
      x = "",
      y = time,
      fill = id_type
    )
  ) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_polar(theta = "y") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_blank()
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "Where does the time go?",
    x = "",
    y = "",
    fill = "Activity"
  )
```



# Ideas for Marketing
